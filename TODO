# ToDo

* Remove unneeded currency headers
* Add gaps between additional balances (add class to first row?)
* Links to accounts in toasts
* Manual import decisions should not be overrided by [Set similar]
* Persist original special transaction to show and edit it as simple src/dest transaction.
* Remove `is_placeholder` account attribute.
